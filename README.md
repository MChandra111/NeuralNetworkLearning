# Neural Network Learning
My journey to building basic neural networks

Sigmoid Vs Tanh Vs ReLU - Explores the differences and use cases of the Sigmoid, Tanh, and ReLU functions as I learned them. The difference of using Google's colab's GPU vs TPU doesn't matter here since I was only building single cell neural networks.

Keras Vs PyTorch Vs TensorFlow - Explores the differences and use cases of Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, as well as the performance differences when using Google's colab's GPU vs TPU.
